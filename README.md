1. Project Description

This JavaScript quiz calculates the results from 16 questions, each having 5 options, and 13 possible results. This quiz uses a custom algorithm, which can calculate more complex results than the commonly available quiz-generator. For comparison, most quizzes use the format "if you picked mostly As, your result is ___", whereas in this quiz each result has a specific mixture of answers; for example, for the 'Gamine' result, the user must pick a nearly equal amount of A and E answers, but with some D answers. The results are presented using the Chart.js library - specifically, the bar chart and the pie chart.
